# VISH - Versatile Interpretive Syntax Handler
I've coded a **Poetic GPT**, showcasing my mastery of multihead attention transformers. This project highlights my commitment to advanced natural language processing, utilizing innovative techniques for refined and creative poetic text generation.
- **Versatility**
The model is flexible and adaptable, capable of handling a wide range of tasks and inputs in the domain of natural language processing.
* **Interpretive** 
It has the ability to understand and interpret various linguistic constructs, ensuring nuanced comprehension of language and context.
+ **Syntax** 
The model excels at managing and manipulating the syntactic structure of language, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually appropriate outputs.
* **Handler**  
It is equipped with the capability to handle linguistic data, suggesting proficiency in processing and managing syntactic elements efficiently.

> The datasets I currently possess are insufficient, and the processing capacity is limited. Consequently, my transformer struggles to grasp the Sense + Tense concept. I believe a substantial increase in the volume of data is essential to train a model effectively, allowing it to discern patterns inherent in language grammar.
